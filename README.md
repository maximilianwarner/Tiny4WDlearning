# Tiny4WDlearning
This is a repository for things I have learnt to build up my Tiny 4WD robot. The Tiny 4WD by Coretec can be found here:

To the standard model shown in the link, I have added two things, a camera, and a laser "Time of Flight" (ToF) distance measure. The aim is to use these to control the robot, both for collision avoidance - not to hit walls or other objects in the robots path, but also to detect objects and features such as walls and doors, and make decisions of what to do.

In order to progress in my Machine Learning, and python programming, tackling such issues has been incredibly valuable. It has been a great way to practice maths and programming skills. Thus, many of the Jupyter notebooks in this series are an aide-memoire for me, but I hope that it might help others in understanding topics I have learnt too.

Please message me if you find any issues in the code.

Many thanks,

Max
